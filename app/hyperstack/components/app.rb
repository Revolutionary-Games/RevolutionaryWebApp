# This is your top level component, the rails router will
# direct all requests to mount this component.  You may
# then use the Route psuedo component to mount specific
# subcomponents depending on the URL.

  # Route('/foo', mounts: Foo)                : match the path beginning with /foo and mount component Foo here
  # Route('/foo') { Foo(...) }                : display the contents of the block
  # Route('/', exact: true, mounts: Home)     : match the exact path / and mount the Home component
  # Route('/user/:id/name', mounts: UserName) : path segments beginning with a colon will be captured in the match param
  # see the hyper-router gem documentation for more details
